 <h1>Is AI The New Learner?</h1>
 <h3>How the use of <em>Artificial Intelligence</em> negatively impacts the academic performance of students nowadays.</h3>
 <p>Recent developments in artificial intelligence platforms, such as Snapchat's "My AI" and ChapGPT, have had a significant impact on education. Although some would contend that artificial intelligence (AI) can be advantageous because it can instantly generate a flawless piece of writing, the repercussions are extremely severe. AI has caused significant problems in education that have affected how pupils learn. The absence of human interaction and reliance on AI are two detrimental effects of AI on education today.</p>

    <h2>Minimizing AI in Learning: The Power of Doing It Yourself</h2>
		
	<h3>AI is here, and it’s changing how we learn, but are we letting it do too much? While AI tools can help with certain tasks, it’s crucial that we don’t rely on them for everything. The key is to minimize AI use and keep learning the old-fashioned way by thinking, creating, and solving problems on our own.</h3>

          Why Minimizing AI is Essential for Our Growth
        </h2>
        <div class="timeline-box">
          <div class="content-box">
            <h3>Critical Thinking Needs Space to Grow</h3>
            <p>Relying too much on AI can make us lazy thinkers. When we minimize AI, we give ourselves the space to think through problems and develop stronger critical thinking skills.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="content-box">
            <h3>Creativity Comes from Effort</h3>
            <p>AI can solve problems, but it can’t think creatively like we can. Minimizing AI gives us the opportunity to innovate and develop unique ideas.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="content-box">
            <h3>Real Learning Happens Through Practice</h3>
            <p>True learning comes from effort and practice. When we minimize AI use, we push ourselves to learn, make mistakes, and improve. The more we do this, the more we grow. AI shouldn’t replace the effort needed to truly understand a subject.</p>
          </div>
<div class="content-box">
            <h3>AI Should Be a Tool, Not a Shortcut</h3>
            <p>AI can be helpful when used wisely, but it should never replace the learning process. By minimizing its role, we ensure that we’re still developing the skills we need, instead of relying on AI to do everything for us.</p>

            <h3>Empowering Students to Think for Themselves:</h3>

          <div class="content-box">
            <h3>Encouraging Balanced Learning Approaches:</h3>

            <h3>Providing Alternatives to AI-Heavy Tools:</h3>
